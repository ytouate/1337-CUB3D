## Technologies Used

* C Programming Language
* Makefile
* Minilbx (a student's graphics library designed by the staff of 42 Network )

## Description

_ This is Project is about creating a 3D or semi-3D game using only C programming language and a graphics library provided by the school named Minilbx
- The library itself does not provide any ready-to-go functions to do the work for you ex: if you want to draw a square you have to implement a function which does that for you, the library just gives you the ability to write pixels into the window so everything that is rendered to the window is implemented from scratch

## Setup/Installation Requirements

* to run the game you just type 'make; ./Cub3D followed by the map to one of the maps in the maps directory provided by me' but You got to have Minilbx installed into your computer
* to run you have to change the Makefile to be Compatible with the linux envirnoment check the documentation <a href="https://harm-smits.github.io/42docs/libs/minilibx/getting_started.html">here</a>
