// the must be surrounded by wallss 
rays are cast and traced in groups
in a 320*200 display resolution a raycaster traces only 320 rays
fast rendering
resulting image is not very realistic
walls are predendicular (90 angle) with the floor
floor is always flat
walls are made of cubes that have the same size (square grid only)

distance between rays is (the FOV / The projection plane )
// ray tracing 
each ray is traced seperately, so each point usually a pixel is traced by one single ray
needs to tra
